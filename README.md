# Unexpected Aggregation Results in MongoDB

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using MongoDB's aggregation framework. The aggregation pipeline is designed to perform a specific task but produces unexpected results due to a flaw in its design.  This could stem from incorrect filtering, grouping, sorting or limiting. The solution provides a corrected pipeline.

## Bug

The original aggregation pipeline in `bug.js` incorrectly calculates the top 10 most frequent values of a field. The issue lies in the pipeline's stages which may contain errors in the filtering, grouping, sorting, or limiting steps.

## Solution

The corrected pipeline in `bugSolution.js` addresses the error by providing a revised approach. This might involve reviewing the filtering criteria, adjusting field names used in the group stage, verifying the sorting order, and ensuring the limit clause aligns with the desired output.
